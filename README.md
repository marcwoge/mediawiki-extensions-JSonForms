# mw-JSonForms

This is a Fork of CIForms. The goal of this Fork is to optimize the Datahandling inside the MySQL-DB using JSon. JSon as Datatype 'Blob' makes it easy to handle the Fomruladata with thirdparty-tools. 
The ability to add an Email Formfield to send the formuladata zo a custom recipient (to/CC/BCC).


# CIForms

CIForms allows rapid creation of forms, either standard forms with input fields aimed at receiving data from visitors, or forms with multiple choice questions or even Cloze tests to administer complex surveys & tests.

All forms include automatic validation, are optionally protected by the latest version of Google recaptcha and have been inspired by this extension (https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page) at Wikiversity and they diverge from it mainly because the submitted data are either stored in the database or sent to a provided email address, rather than used to compute a score.

Please check https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CIForms for the official documentation.
